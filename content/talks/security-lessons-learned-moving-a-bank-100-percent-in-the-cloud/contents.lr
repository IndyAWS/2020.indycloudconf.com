abstract:
This session provides observations regarding the process of moving the datacenter assets of a Top100 bank fully into the cloud. The Golden Rules providing security and assurance will be described. The gotchas, surprises, lessons learned, and resulting strategic changes are presented.

In our cloud migration process in 2018, we moved everything to AWS in a Lift & Shift process. We had a robust security stack in our managed datacenter environment and learned many lessons about pursuing native options. In 2019, we have started the app moderization phase to move from IaaS-based workloads to PaaS, serverless, and containers.
