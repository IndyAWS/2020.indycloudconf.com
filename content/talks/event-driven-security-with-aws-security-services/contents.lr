abstract:
Centralized cloud security and compliance combined with democratized incident response can ensure that the right information gets to the right teams, at the right time, so security events can be managed swiftly and appropriately. In this presentation, we show how a flexible combination of security controls, automation, API integrations, IoT, and notification services can enhance your Security Operations teamâ€™s effectiveness and allow developers to also embrace and support response efforts.
