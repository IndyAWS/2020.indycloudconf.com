During this same period, he served as president of CVQ, a datacenter design, construction, and operation firm. In 2009, he was a finalist for the Ernest & Young Entrepreneur of Year award.

Qualls is the president emeritus of Eleven Fifty Coding Academy.

During his tenure, the team up-skilled over 3,000 adults from 23 states and 4 countries. Qualls designed, implemented, and grew an immersive boot-camp style program for over 300 students with a 90% graduation rate and over 80% placement rate.  While under Quallsâ€™ helm, Eleven Fifty Academy was approved for the GI Bill and was recognized by the Department of Labor as a certified apprenticeship program.

As an entrepreneur, Qualls is dedicated to developing local talent to stimulate growth and move Indiana forward. His role at Purposely will support that mission.

abstract:
While cloud computing has transformed the way products are built, managed and brought to market; one area continues to hold back the full potential for all stakeholders . . . talent. John Qualls discusses the emerging market of Talent Optimization. Designing better teams, hiring harder to manage easier, inspiring geographically diverse teams, all means that leaders will have to have new tools and approaches to solving people problems. With the acceleration of digital transformation, it will be the people you hire and inspire who will take your organization to the next level (or miss out taking it there!)
